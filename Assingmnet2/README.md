# Programming Assignments

This directory contains four separate Python programs as part of the assignment:

## 1. Grade Checker
**Location:** `Grade_Checker/grade_checker.py`

**Description:** Takes a score as input and prints the grade based on the following:
- 90+: "A"
- 80-89: "B"
- 70-79: "C"
- 60-69: "D"
- Below 60: "F"

**Implementation:** Uses basic if-else statements to determine grades.

## 2. Student Grades
**Location:** `Student_Grades/student_grades.py`

**Description:** Creates a dictionary where the keys are student names and values are their grades. Allows the user to:
- Add a new student and grade
- Update an existing student's grade
- Print all student grades

**Implementation:** Uses dictionary and basic operations with if-else statements.

## 3. Write to a File
**Location:** `Write_to_File/write_to_file.py`

**Description:** Creates a text file and writes user-provided content to it.

**Implementation:** Uses file functions like `write()` and `open()`.

## 4. Read from a File
**Location:** `Read_from_File/read_from_file.py`

**Description:** Reads content from a text file and displays it.

**Implementation:** Uses `open()` in read mode and `file.read()` to read and print content.

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the respective directory for each program
2. Run the Python file using: `python filename.py`
3. Follow the on-screen prompts

## Submission

This project contains all four required programs in separate directories with appropriate documentation. Each program includes detailed comments explaining the implementation and functionality.
